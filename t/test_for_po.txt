<gt>Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An
operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
your computer run. Debian uses the Linux kernel (the core of an
operating system), but most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU
project; hence the name GNU/Linux.</gt>
