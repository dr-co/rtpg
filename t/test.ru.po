"Debian is a free operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating "
"system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer "
"run. Debian uses the Linux kernel (the core of an operating system), but "
"most of the basic OS tools come from the GNU project; hence the name "
"GNU/Linux."
